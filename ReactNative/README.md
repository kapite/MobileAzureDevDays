# Abstract
This simple app has a Text Entry Box and a button that triggers the text to hit the [Azure Sentiment Analysis API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/text-analytics/how-tos/text-analytics-how-to-sentiment-analysis) and returns a corresponding Emoji and changes the background color appropriately.

# Get Started with React Native
The Mobile Center SDK uses a modular architecture so you can use any or all of the services.

Let's get started with setting up Mobile Center React Native SDK in your app to use Mobile Center Analytics and Mobile Center Crashes

## 1. Prerequisites
Before you begin, please make sure that the following prerequisites are met:
   * You are using a React Native project that runs React Native 0.34 or later.
   * You are targeting devices that are running on Android Version 4.0.3/API level 15 or later, or iOS version 8.0 or later.
   * The default way to use the SDK requires [Cocoapods](https://cocoapods.org/). Nonetheless, it is possible to link the SDK manually.

## 2. Create your app in the Mobile Center Portal to obtain the App Secret
If you have already created your app in the Mobile Center portal, you can skip this step.
  1) Head over to [mobile.azure.com](https://mobile.azure.com).
  2) Sign up or log in and hit the blue button on the top right corner of the portal that says **Add new** and select **Add new app** from the dropdown menu.
  3) Enter a name and an optional desciption for your app.
  4) Select the appropriate OS (Android or iOS) and select **React Native** as the platform.
  5) Hit the button at the bottom right that says **Add new app**.
Once you have created an app, you can obtain its **App Secret** on the **Getting Started** or **Manage App** sections of the Mobile Center Portal.
